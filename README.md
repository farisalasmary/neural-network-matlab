# Neural Network in Matlab/Octave Code
Implementation of vanilla neural network (Fully Connected Neural Network) in pure Matlab/Octave code without libraries.

I implemented Batch Gradient Descent only. 

The dataset used in this repository was downloaded from [here](http://datacenter.aucegypt.edu/shazeem/).
